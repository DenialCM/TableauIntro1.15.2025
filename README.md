"Raw data generation script.R" generates "dummy_dataset_raw.csv".
"Data cleaning script.R" takes "dummy_dataset_raw.csv" and outputs "demographic_data.csv" and "pivoted_data.csv".
The Tableau workbook uses "demographic_data.csv" and "pivoted_data.csv" as its input files.
"2025_DATA.xlsx" is a separate Excel file to demonstrate adding new data into Tableau.
"Tableau presentation for AU.pptx" are my slides from the presentation.
Please contact catherine.m.denial@dartmouth.edu if you have any questions about these files or about Tableau more generally!
Have a great time on your Tableau journey!
